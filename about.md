<main>
I grew up in a rural community and have always been fascinated by the connection between science, people, and nature.  
My research experience includes working in **Prof. Oded Livnah’s biochemistry lab**, focusing on protein purification and interaction studies.

I’m motivated by curiosity and empathy — drawn both to **medicine** and **scientific discovery**.

Outside the lab, I love learning new things and exploring how technology can support biology and medicine.
